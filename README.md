# SpaceBallsVR
Sample VR game for Windows Mixed Reality immersive headsets where you shoot asteroids at planets. This game is used to teach Windows Mixed Reality development at conferences using a step-by-step approach. This demo was premiered at CodeMash in Sandusky, OH in in January 2018. 

This is a work in a progress that I am sharing publicly as I add features. This project is shared "as is" for educational purposes only.
